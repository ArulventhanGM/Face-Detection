# Face Recognition System

A comprehensive face recognition system that detects and identifies faces in real-time group photos or individual images.

## Features

- **Real-time Face Detection**: Process group photos or individual images
- **Face Recognition**: Match detected faces with preloaded face data
- **Admin Panel**: Upload known face images with metadata
- **User Interface**: Upload test images and view recognition results
- **Structured Results**: Display all matched individuals with their details

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask, face_recognition library
- **Frontend**: React, Axios
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV, PIL

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** with pip
- **Node.js 16+** with npm
- **Git** (for cloning)

### Quick Start (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArulventhanGM/Face-Detection.git
   cd Face-Detection
   ```

2. **Start the complete system**:
   ```bash
   # Double-click this file on Windows:
   start-system.bat
   
   # Or run manually:
   start "Backend" start-backend.bat
   start "Frontend" start-frontend.bat
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5000

### Manual Setup

#### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Initialize database:
   ```bash
   python models.py
   ```

5. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

#### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation, especially with the `face_recognition` library:

**🚨 SETUPTOOLS ERROR FIX:**
If you get "Cannot import 'setuptools.build_meta'" error, try these solutions in order:

1. **Emergency Fix (Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   emergency-setup-backend.bat
   ```

2. **Docker Solution (Most Reliable)**:
   ```bash
   start-with-docker.bat
   ```

3. **Minimal Setup (No face_recognition)**:
   ```bash
   start-minimal.bat
   ```

**Other Common Issues:**
- **Timeout errors** → Use improved scripts with longer timeouts
- **Visual C++ Build Tools missing** → Install from Microsoft
- **CMake not found** → Download and install CMake
- **Python 3.13 compatibility** → Use Python 3.9-3.11

## Usage

1. **Admin Panel**: Upload known face images with metadata (name, ID, etc.)
2. **Face Recognition**: Upload test images to identify faces
3. **Results**: View matched individuals with their details in a structured format

## API Endpoints
